# Mad Libs

#### By Olivia Hinton & Neva Wood | Date: June 1, 2016

## Project Guidelines

* Make a form letter where the user inputs their name, and they get back a letter addressed to them. Feel free to use lorum ipsum for the text of the letter. Use Bootstrap and your knowledge of CSS to make the letter look like a letter.
* Create a page that asks the user to type something into a field, and when they submit the form, have the page say it back to them in all uppercase.
